# Taskick

Taskick is an event-driven Python library that automatically executes scripts or any commands.
It not only automates tedious routine tasks and operations, but also makes it easy to develop [applications](#toy-example).

Users can concentrate on developing scripts to run, and simply create a configuration file (YAML) to automatically execute scripts triggered by any date, time, or event.

The main features of Taskick are as follows

- Script execution timing can be managed in a configuration file (YAML).
- Can specify datetime and directory/file operations as task triggers.
- Execution schedules can be specified in Crontab format.
- [Watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) is used to detect directory and file operations. It is also possible to specify any [events API](https://python-watchdog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#module-watchdog.events) on the configuration file.

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install taskick
$ python -m taskick
Taskick 0.1.5
usage: __main__.py [-h] [--verbose] [--version] [--file FILE [FILE ...]]
                   [--log_config LOG_CONFIG]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --verbose, -v         increase the verbosity of messages: '-v' for normal
                        output, '-vv' for more verbose output and '-vvv' for
                        debug
  --version, -V         display this application version and exit
  --file FILE [FILE ...], -f FILE [FILE ...]
                        select task configuration files (YAML)
  --log_config LOG_CONFIG, -l LOG_CONFIG
                        select a logging configuration file (YAML or other)
$ python -m taskick -V
Taskick 0.1.5a0
```

## Toy Example

Here is a toy-eample that converts a PNG image to PDF.
In this sample, Taskick starts a script when it detects that a PNG image has been saved to a specific folder.
The script converts the PNG to PDF and saves it in another folder.
For more information, please see the [project page](https://github.com/atsuyaide/taskick-example).

First, clone [taskick-example](https://github.com/atsuyaide/taskick-example).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/atsuyaide/taskick-example.git
```

Go to the cloned directory and start Taskick.

```shell
$ cd taskick-example
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m taskick -f jobconf.yaml -vv

INFO:taskick:Executing: example_task_1

Sat Mar 19 23:51:47 JST 2022 Welcome to Taskick!
```

When a PNG image is saved in the input folder, a converted PDF file is output in the output folder.
Files in the input folder are automatically deleted at startup or every minute.

These tasks are controlled by `jobconf.yaml` and managed by Taskick.
